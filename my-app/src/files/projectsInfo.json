                "paragraph_1": "Growing up I fell in love with playing games to the point where even now I am still passionate about video games.They have been an integral part in my childhood with many memories of the older games bringing me joy and excitement. Particularly, I was very fascinated by the Final Fantasy Series published by Square Enix. I instantly fell in love with the turn-based strategy RPG aspect of the game which promoted the character to mix and match classes and skills together. I set out to create a game to replicate this turn-based combat system to offer as a tribute and to add some exploration in with it.",
                "paragraph_2": "This project was developed using the Unity game engine alongside the programming language C#. Through this project, I got the chance to learn cool and amazing things about game development. For instance, with coding movement of a character within the game, we had to learn/re-learn about vectors which are used to calculate the characters speed and direction. Additionally, I learned more about asynchronous functions such as Await() and WaitUntil() which were imperative for a turn-based game. The UI was simple and somewhat plain as there was a time constraint. However, it allowed me to learn about UI management using C# and Unity. To add final touches to the project, music was added to give it a more finished/complete feel. As I am enthusiastic about games, this project no doubt was so much fun to design and develop and, on top of that, the knowledge I gained from it was quite powerful."
