They have been an integral part in my childhood with many memories of the older games bringing me joy and excitement. Particularly, I was very fascinated by the Final Fantasy Series published by Square Enix. I instantly fell in love with the turn-based strategy RPG aspect of the game which promoted the character to mix and match classes and skills together. I set out to create a game to replicate this turn-based combat system to offer as a tribute and to add some exploration in with it."
