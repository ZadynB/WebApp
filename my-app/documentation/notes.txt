To fix/do:
[Solved/Done]
- figure out a way to change the section on the About page efficiently (Proxy??)
    -> Solution: Use the useState function along with a callback function to do this cleanly.
- add a StackedNavBar to the right of the page so that users can navigate to specific sections
- check and try to fix the weird functionality with the carousel
    -> fiddle a bit more with it
    -> Solution: created custom carousel using react-spring and useState.
- update the stackedNavbar so that it can return either buttons or listText items
- add a new component to be used as a project container for dynamic use
    -> add a new section to display some of the tools + description
    -> add styling to the ProjectsContainer.js
- add functionality to the info button and the projectContainer to display a modal with more details.
- add code to get the images and write the rest of the descriptions.
- add contact info icons to developers page (email, linkedin)
- clean up the nav bar
- clean up the home screen
    -> set up the app grid using the Grid element
    -> set up transitions/springs for the app tiles
    -> create app tiles
- add css for data grids to look nice on mobile
- create custome pagination for the data grid
- implemented transition for modal



[In Progress]
- start checking out back end stuff
